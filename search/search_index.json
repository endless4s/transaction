It is a simple tool to simplify the process of coordinating transactions using a two-phase commit protocol.\nThis is not “old-school” 2PC however: the library abstractions can be used to describe any form of two-phase consensus, allowing for both short and long-lived transactions (aka sagas).","title":""},{"location":"/getting-started.html","text":"","title":"Getting Started ·"},{"location":"/getting-started.html#getting-started","text":"Add the following dependency to your build.sbt file:\nlibraryDependencies += \"io.github.endless4s\" %% \"endless-transaction\" % \"0.0.2\"\nThis will pull in the module containing the abstractions. You should add this dependency to the project that contains your business domain logic (typically “domain”).\nThe Pekko runtime is available in endless-transaction-pekko and provides PekkoTransactor, an implementation of Transactor which is the entry-point to create a transaction coordinator (for Akka, use endless-transaction-akka).\nCompatibility Since Pekko/Akka do not allow mixed versions in a project, dependencies of endless-transaction-pekko (and endless-transaction-akka respectively) are marked a Provided. This means that your application libraryDependencies needs to directly include Pekko or Akka as a direct dependency. The minimal supported Pekko version is 1.0.0, and Akka version is 2.6.20.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"/nutshell.html","text":"","title":"In a nutshell ·"},{"location":"/nutshell.html#in-a-nutshell","text":"While the traditional two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is synchronous and blocking, endless-transaction is designed to be asynchronous and non-blocking and features fine-grained failure and retry semantics. It can be used as a ready-made tool to achieve various degrees of consistency in distributed systems, relying behind the scenes on an actor cluster for scalability and resilience.\nThe three tenants of the 2PC protocol are prepare, commit, and abort: in endless-transaction, participating branches have full flexibility in defining effectful expressions for the three operations. For certain domains, strong consistency and locking might be required. For others, some degree of inconsistency can be tolerated. It can even be a mix of both in a single transaction. The lifetime of the transaction isn’t limited either, transaction timeout tracking is optional.\nDiverse forms of two-phase consensus appear frequently in service-oriented systems, especially when involving complex business workflows and heterogeneous data stores. Its usefulness goes beyond the specific area of strongly consistent, atomic transactions such as XA. Long-running transactions, also known as sagas, typically make use of rollback or undo operations in the abort phase, also called compensating transactions.\nAbstractions in the library are implemented by one of the two available runtimes, Pekko or Akka. Internally, transactions are materialized with a persistent sharded entity implementing the two-phase protocol asynchronously with at least once delivery guarantee.","title":"In a nutshell"},{"location":"/2pc.html","text":"","title":"Two-phase commit protocol ·"},{"location":"/2pc.html#two-phase-commit-protocol","text":"The three tenants of the 2PC protocol are prepare, commit, and abort: in endless-transaction, participating branches define effectful expressions for the three operations.","title":"Two-phase commit protocol"},{"location":"/2pc.html#prepare","text":"Validate a query value, possibly effect the local branch context, and return a vote value. The vote is a signal for the coordinator to either commit or abort the transaction. This expression can involve any kind of asynchronous process, and there is no limit to the time it takes for the vote to be delivered to the coordinator (unless a timeout is configured). Below are some examples of prepare operations in an imaginary (and somewhat convoluted) touristic journey booking process:\nExample: orchestration of the booking process for a journey Data store Transaction branch operation Create cancelable hotel & flight reservations External API Make a reversible synchronous HTTP POST/PUT request Request the billing back-end for credit card guarantee charge and await confirmation Internal service Send a message or call an endpoint and wait for an event to occur Add details to the customer row in the database Database Acquire an exclusive lock on a database row or use built-in XA support Grab a semaphore to update the “recent bookings” cache In-memory resource Lock an in-memory resource Schedule traveller reminder notifications Actor cluster Send a command to an actor Add an entry in a bookings log File Persist a rollback-ready change in a file","title":"Prepare"},{"location":"/2pc.html#commit","text":"This is triggered by the coordinator after all branches have voted for commit. The branch is expected to effect the local context to make at least part of the change durable and return a confirmation value.\nLike for prepare above, this expression can involve any kind of asynchronous process, and the toolkit does not impose a limit on the time it takes for the confirmation to be delivered to the coordinator.\nSome examples of commit operations in the same imaginary touristic journey booking process:\nExample: orchestration of the booking process for a journey Data store Transaction branch operation Do nothing: reservations were already made External API Send a message or call and endpoint of another service Do nothing: the guarantee charge was already made Internal service Send a message to another service Update customer details in the internal database Database Perform the row update and unlock Update the “recent bookings” cache and release the semaphore In-memory resource Edit and unlock an in-memory resource Do nothing: the reminder notifications were already scheduled Actor cluster Send a command to an actor Do nothing: the bookings log was already updated File Persist a change in a file\nConsistency It’s up to the implementer to decide the level of consistency in the execution of the commit. Transaction failure is also a valid state and can be signaled by raising an exception in the target effect. This will lead to some degree of inconsistency in the overall system state, but that can be an acceptable compromise in some use cases. For instance, in our imaginary example the “in-memory cache” could be locked only for a short time to preserve throughput. Because it’s not essential to the journey process, updating it could be skipped in case of delays. On the other hand, if the “internal database” update would still fail despite the lock, this could be signaled by raising an exception. This would conclude the transaction in a failed state, which could be surfaced in the UI to allow for manual remediation.","title":"Commit"},{"location":"/2pc.html#abort","text":"This is triggered by the coordinator after at least one branch has voted for abort.

In this dummy example, let’s suppose traveler reminders have already been sent, a compensation action could be to schedule a new notification inviting the customer to ignore previous messages.

The transaction state machine diagram is depicted below. As usual, side-effects are invoked after successful event persistence, and repeated in case of recovery (at least once delivery characteristics).\nConsider the use case carefully Certain use cases call for different techniques: for instance, the classical challenge of publishing events to a broker atomically with a change in a database is best solved by the simpler transaction outbox pattern or event sourcing.\n2PC is often used in distributed technologies Distributed databases such as CockroachDB, MongoDB, and others implement 2PC to atomically store values across partitions.

No constraints are set on the effects a branch can have: it can describe interactions with heterogeneous systems via HTTP, multiple entities in a cluster, etc. timeout: optional timeout for transaction preparation.
